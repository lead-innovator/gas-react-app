# React App Deployment on Google App Script 

This project creates a react version of Klotski game running on Google Web using Google Apps Script. 
The game interface includes a timer to track the each game duration, which on game completion, 
will be written to a google spreadsheet, and later retrieved and displayed.

The project template is taken from the source code of 
[Japanese Klotski Puzzle](https://github.com/ziqingW/Japan-klotski).

The icons in the projects are taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=bird)

The app can be accessible using Chrome browser via the link <br>
