# React App Deployment on Google App Script 

This project creates a react version of Klotski game running on Google Web using Google Apps Script. 
The game interface includes a timer to track each game duration, and on game completion, 
the timing is written to a google spreadsheet, which can later be retrieved and displayed.

The project adapted from a Klotski game written in react:
[Japanese Klotski Puzzle](https://github.com/ziqingW/Japan-klotski).

The icons in the projects are taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=bird).

The app can be accessible using Chrome browser via the link <br>
